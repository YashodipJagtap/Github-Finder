## Introduction
**GitHub Finder** is a React-based application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and view detailed information about them. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for searching and displaying GitHub user profiles, making it easier for developers to explore GitHub profiles and their repositories.

---

## Problem Statement
Developers often need to search for GitHub profiles to explore repositories, contributions, and other details. However, the process can be time-consuming and inefficient when done manually. The challenges include:
- **Manual Search**: Searching for GitHub profiles directly on GitHub can be cumbersome.
- **Lack of Centralized Information**: No easy way to view a GitHub user's profile details in one place.
- **Limited Features**: GitHub's native search does not provide a quick overview of a user's key details.

---

## Solution
GitHub Finder addresses these challenges by providing:
- A **simple search interface** to find GitHub profiles quickly
- **Comprehensive profile details** including bio, location, and repositories
- **Direct links** to GitHub profiles for further exploration
- **Clear functionality** to reset searches
